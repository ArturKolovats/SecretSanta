The site has the option
1) create a room and get a unique key
2) connect to the room by entering a unique key
3) start the game by entering a unique key

the game is available only for a pair of participants, after the start of the game, each participant is sent a letter with the recipient - for this I use [emailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/), all user data is stored in firebase and a separate room is created for each unique key
